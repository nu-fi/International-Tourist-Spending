# International Tourist Spending Analysis - Indonesia

## Objective:
This project analyzes the factors that influence international tourist spending in Indonesia, using data on country of origin, length of stay, and total visits.

## Data Overview:
The dataset includes variables such as tourist origin, length of stay, total visits, and average spending per visit.

## Methodology:
- Data Cleaning: Removed outliers and handled missing values.
- EDA: Visualized distributions and relationships between key variables.
- Regression Model: Built a multiple linear regression model to predict tourist spending.

## Key Findings:
- Tourists from the US, Europe, and Oceania spend significantly more.
- Longer stays increase tourist spending.
- Increased visits have a small but significant impact on spending.

## Model Evaluation:
- R-squared: 0.46
- Significant predictors: Country of origin, length of stay, and total visits.

## Recommendations:
- Target high-spending markets (Amerika, Eropa, Oceania).
- Promote longer stays through extended visas or packages.
- Focus on increasing visit numbers.

## Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
